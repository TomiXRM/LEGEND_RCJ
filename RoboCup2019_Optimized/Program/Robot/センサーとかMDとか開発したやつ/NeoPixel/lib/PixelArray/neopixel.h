/** Control an array or chain of NeoPixel-compatible RGB LEDs.
 *
 * "NeoPixel" is Adafruit's name for WS2812- and WS2811-based addressable RGB
 * LEDs. This library should work with any WS2811- or WS2812-based devices, as
 * long as they support the fast-mode (800kHz) interface.
 *
 * Most example code uses bit-banging to generate the timed signal precisely.
 * This library uses an SPI peripheral instead. The main advantage of this is
 * that the chip can service interrupts and the like without disrupting the
 * signal (as long as the interrupts don't take _too_ long). The main
 * disadvantage is that it requires the use of an SPI peripheral.
 *
 * @note SPI peripherals will tend to leave the output pin ('MOSI') floating
 * after a packet is sent. This will confuse the connected pixels, which expect
 * the line to be driven low when idle. One way to fix this is to add a 10k
 * resistor between 'MOSI' and ground so that it drops to '0' when not driven.
 * Another method is to enable the on-chip pull-down resistor on the output pin.
 * However, the mbed API only exposes this function through the DigitalIn and
 * DigitalInOut classes. If you want to use the on-chip pull-down, you'll have
 * to temporarily connect a DigitalIn peripheral _before_ creating instantiating
 * the PixelArray.
 *
 * @code
 * // Sample generator: Cycle through each colour combination, increasing the
 * // brightness each time. `extra` is used as an iteration counter.
 * void generate(neopixel::Pixel * out, uint32_t index, uintptr_t extra) {
 *   uint32_t brightness = (index + extra) >> 3;
 *   out->red   = ((index + extra) & 0x1) ? brightness : 0;
 *   out->green = ((index + extra) & 0x2) ? brightness : 0;
 *   out->blue  = ((index + extra) & 0x4) ? brightness : 0;
 * }
 *
 * int main() {
 *   // Create a temporary DigitalIn so we can configure the pull-down resistor.
 *   // (The mbed API doesn't provide any other way to do this.)
 *   // An alternative is to connect an external pull-down resistor.
 *   DigitalIn(p5, PullDown);
 *
 *   // The pixel array control class.
 *   neopixel::PixelArray array(p5);
 *
 *   uint32_t offset = 0;
 *   while (1) {
 *     array.update(generate, 100, offset++);

 * - You want to display a frame pattern that can be generated procedurally
